In my time at ebi, I worked on a range of .NET apps. Predominately working with .NET core, I built greenfield ASP.NET APIs and Blazor apps including an admin system and a new user account system (pictured above).

I also took on responsibility for managing the Azure infrastructure, gaining experience with Storage, Service Bus and many other services.

One of my projects involved replacing a legacy Ruby on Rails system with a new Blazor app. I used this to gain a moderate amount of experience with Ruby.
